The expectation of the University of Southern Mississippi is that students should spend approximately 2 to 3 hours outside of class each week for every hour in class working on reading, assignments, studying, and other work for the course. Time management is thus critical for student success. All students should assess their personal circumstances and talk with their advisors about the appropriate number of credit hours to take each term.

All information submitted to ODA by the student is held with strict confidentiality. 1.10 Mental Well-Being Statement I recognize that students sometimes experience challenges that make learning difficult. If you find that life stressors such as anxiety, depression, relationship problems, difficulty concentrating, alcohol or drug problems, or other stressful experiences are interfering with your academic or personal success, consider contacting Student Counseling Services on campus at 601-266-4829.

I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on USM’s campus with certain University officials responsible for the investigation and remediation of sexual misconduct. The information will remain private and will only be shared with those officials necessary to resolve the matter.

Forms of academic dishonesty include cheating (including copying from others’ work), plagiarism (representing another person’s words or ideas as your own; failure to properly cite the source of your information, argument, or concepts), falsification of documents, disclosure of or use of test material or other assignment content to another student, submission of the same paper or other assignment to more than one class without the explicit approval of all faculty members involved, unauthorized academic collaboration with others, conspiracy to engage in academic misconduct. Engaging in any of these behaviors or supporting others who do so will result in academic penalties and/or other sanctions. If a faculty member determines that a student has violated our Academic Integrity Policy, sanctions ranging from resubmission of work to course failure may occur, including the possibility of receiving a grade of “XF” for the course, which will be on the student’s transcript with the notation “Failure due to academic misconduct.” "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
